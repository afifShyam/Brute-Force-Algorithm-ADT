# Brute-Force-Algorithm-ADT

A group of team in a programming contest usually consist of 3 members per
group. You just form a group with two of your friends to enter a contest. Each
of your group member has its own strength in using certain Algorithm Design
Technique as can be seen in the following table:
Table 1. Example of time taken for each member to solve problem based on ADT

Member  |Time Taken to solve problem based on ADT             |
--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
        |Brute Force | Divide and Conquer | Greedy Algorithm  |
A       |     10     |       20           |         13        |
B       |     11     |       15           |         15        |
C       |      8     |       18           |         12        |
---------------------------------------------------------------

Input should be number of questions in the competition, number of question 
belonging to brute Force, Divide and conquer and greedy algorithm and time 
taken for all THREE members to solve the problem based on the ADT(as 
shown in above Table). The output would be the fastest time taken to 
complete the competition.
